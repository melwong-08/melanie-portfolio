            My name is Melanie, I'm from Los Angeles and I'm learning to become a web developer. 
          </p>
          <p>I gradauted from UCLA with a degree in neuroscience. Neuroscience!...you say, why aren't you in med school?! Well, let's just say that path wasn't for me :)<br>
            I learned I loved web development at a part time position with DGSOM's IT department and haven't looked back since.</p>

          <p>
            Hello, and thanks for sticking around! I grew up in California and went to college at UCLA where I got my Neurscience, B.S. About half way through my degree, 
            I thought that neuroscience might not be the best career path for me, but I was too stubborn to change my major in the middle of college. So I kept with it
            and got a job in a tech start-up company.
          </p> 
          <p>
            Since then I've decided I want to continue pursuing my interest in web development instead of going down the medical
            route. So I've been a student at <a href="https://www.thinkful.com/">Thinkful</a> since April, and I'm on my way to becoming a web developer! I'm looking forward
            to working with other developers to create websites.
